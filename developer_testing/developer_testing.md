## Developer Testing in Next.js

Testing is crucial to ensure the reliability and quality of your Next.js application. Next.js supports various testing approaches, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

### Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of your application in isolation.

#### Testing React Components

You can use Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing React components.

Example test file (`MyComponent.test.js`):

```javascript
// MyComponent.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from '../MyComponent';

test('renders MyComponent', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
  const element = getByText('Hello, Next.js!');
  expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
});
